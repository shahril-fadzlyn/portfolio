Hi, I'm Shah! This is my first attempt at creating my portfolio site while learning ChatGPT, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

I have already learned HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. To build a solid foundation, I followed a tutorial by SuperSimpleDev on YouTubeâ€”shout-out to Simon for his awesome content! After completing the tutorial, I wanted to challenge myself by building my portfolio site from scratch. However, I quickly realized how overwhelming the process can be.

I was also curious about CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS, but with so much to learn, I didnâ€™t want to fall into the trap of endlessly watching tutorials. After some exploration, I decided to focus on Tailwind CSS because of its simplicity and well-documented styling classes. Instead of consuming more tutorials, I took a hands-on approach, creating my portfolio site with the help of ChatGPT while troubleshooting issues through Stack Overflow and W3Schools.

This journey has been tough but rewarding. Iâ€™ve learned that while AI tools like ChatGPT can be incredibly helpful, understanding coding fundamentals is crucial. Through trial and error, I managed to debug my site and make it fully responsive.

So, here it isâ€”my first project! ðŸš€
